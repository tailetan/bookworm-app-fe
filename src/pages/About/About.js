                <h3>Our Story</h3>
                <p>
                    The name Bookworm was taken from the original name for New York International Airport,
                    which was renamed JFK in December 1963.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our Manhattan store has just moved to the West Village. Our new location is 170 7th Avenue
                    South, at the corner of Perry Street.
                </p>
                <p>From March 2008 through May 2016, the store was located in the Flatiron District.</p>

                <h3>Our Vision</h3>
                <p>One of the last travel bookstores in the country, our Manhattan store carries a range of
                    guidebooks (all 10% off) to suit the needs and tastes of every traveller and budget.</p>
                <p>We believe that a novel or travelogue can be just as valuable a key to a place as any guidebook,
                    and our well-read, well-travelled staff is happy to make reading recommendations for any
                    traveller, book lover, or gift giver.</p>
